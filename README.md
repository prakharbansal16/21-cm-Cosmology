# 21-cm-Cosmology

The code is aimed at obtaining constrainits on **millicharged dark matter models** by tracking the temperature of dark matter particles and baryons.

Description of Files

1. **21cm_PB.py** (Under Progress) - Code to track the temperature and calculate brightness temperature as a function of redshift
2. **21cm.ipynb** (Under Progress) - Jupyter Notebook to test the workings of the code, also contains the code used to reprdouce the results of Muñoj et al (1509.00029)
3. **xedata.csv** - File containing xe as a function of redshift, generated using HYREC
4. **Muñoj Plots** - Folder containing the plots reproduced
